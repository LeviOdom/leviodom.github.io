Perhaps it should have been titled “The Suggestion.”\nI’m a father of three, all 5 and under. My stay-at-home wife has an arm that’s been giving her trouble since last July. And I have issues with sleep. Needless to say, as per the title of this article and section, sometimes life happens, and fecal matter hits the fan.\nWhat to do when life happens? I don’t have a foolproof plan. I do, however, have some ideas.\n1. Try to be prepared for the unexpected, especially when you expect it. #\rThere are times when life decides to take a nice healthy dump on our situation without us ever seeing it coming. One minute we’re watching Golden Girls on the couch and the next - BOOM - turd in the living room. Sudden deaths in the family, car crashes, natural disasters - there’s always something that can hit you out of nowhere. Then there are other times when yellow flags can be seen just before the red ones. That is to say, sometimes horrible events can be predicted. Job loss, moving costs, that dreaded season that flowers sprout mocking the ill-health it forebodes for your asthmatic children, etc.\nFor those yellow-flag times, try to have some savings built up. Dave Ramsey (yes, some of the stuff he says has some merit) recommends finding the amount of money you spend in a month and having 3 to 6 times that amount saved. This gives you 3 to 6 months in case you need to take a leave of absence from work for whatever reason, or you need to make an emergency purchase. Just don\u0026rsquo;t forget to replenish the savings after you get to a better place.\n2. Reach out to friends and family #\rIn addition to using your monetary savings, reach out to friends and relatives to see if they could help you when the worst happens, and not just with money. Emotional support is sometimes more needed than monetary support. Don’t expect anything because of past good you have done, but humbly come to those you are close to.\n3. Reach out to the community #\rIf you are religious, consider reaching out to your local religious institutions for resources, both monetary and emotional. They may also be able to point you in the right direction of finding 3rd-party resources you weren’t aware of. Look online for events and groups in your area that might be giving out free meals or supplies.\nWhen my family has struggled in the past for money, we’ve used government resources and community free events/food pantries to get what we need to get by. Government resources are funded by your tax dollars, and you should always be donating what you don’t need or use (or even things you normally would use, but know someone else could use more) to charities and the community for those in need. You never know when one of those people might be you.\n4. Throw out shame #\rThe one thing that seems the hardest to deal with, especially for those unfamiliar with being in need, is the intense shame. We often prevent ourselves from seeking help due to our feelings of failure. This idea of failing produces shame and can be a huge barrier in seeking help. The problem is that your survival means throwing out shame, for now. It’s okay to feel shame in certain things, but not in seeking help when you truly need it. There’s nothing shameful about that. And many people are willing to help someone truly in need.\n5. Keep moving forward #\rThough shame needs to be removed, there’s no reason you should remain in the position you are in. Set your sights on an achievable goal that will benefit your situation and strive for it. This is easy when the fan-hitting occurred due to job loss or car crash, but when the difficulty is when a close friend or loved one dies, the next step is often something more personal and hard to pin down. It may be going through their things or forgiving someone who wronged you. Regardless of the goal, try to find one. It may just be getting up out of bed that day. Set the goal, do it, and keep moving to the next one.\nIf your situation is due to someone else, try to move toward forgiveness. Never forget the pain you’ve been through, but try to forgive those who may have caused it. It’s pointless to hold the grudges that settle in our chests and furrow our brows when we could be breathing deeply and smiling in spite of those who set us back. We hurt ourselves more when we refuse to move on. So keep moving forward.\n6. Give back #\rWhen life stops happening to you and you start to happen to life, don’t forget to use those feet that are now under you to take steps to help others. Give to charities that gave to you. Tell others about resources you used when you were in need or struggling. Be there for people who experience grief and loss. Don’t forget to give back to yourself either. Re-invest new money in savings and prep for something that might come next.\nNew Normal #\rLife happens. It’s unavoidable. The good news is that when we have our downs, we often start to appreciate the things that make life so special. As the old saying goes, when you hit the bottom, there’s nowhere to go but up. You will have your ups again. Reach out to your network, forget your shame, and set your goals. Finally, when you go up, don’t forget to help others who are down.\nMay God Bless you.\n","date":"12 June 2023","permalink":"/posts/life_happens/","section":"Posts","summary":"It hits the fan #\rMy last post was entitled “The Plan”.","title":"Life Happens"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/unexpected/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"unexpected"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/curriculum-vitae/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"curriculum vitae"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/education/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"education"},{"content":"Skills #\rServer Administration \u0026ndash;\nMicrosoft Server 2008 - 2022 Administration\nActive Directory, DNS, and Group Policy\nBackup and Security Solutions\nHyper-V and ESXi\nScripting for Automation and Process Streamlining\nSoftware Development \u0026ndash;\nObject Oriented Programming\nSoftware Development Lifecycle\nFull Stack Development\nProgramming/Scripting Languages, Frameworks, and Features\u0026hellip; #\rthat I know well #\rC#, .NET, Blazor, Java, Powershell, Transact-SQL\nthat I know casually #\rBash, Python, Javascript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS,\nCareer #\rParrish Consulting Services #\rEnterprise Systems Team (April 2022 - May 2023)\nInstalled and Migrated domain/application servers for local government entities and companies\nTransitioned software from out-dated client servers to updated machines in 5+ companies\nTransitioned clients from physical-based servers to flexible Hyper-V-hosted virtual environments\nDesigned and secured data access schemas on the company/department level using GPO and AD\nMaintained server environments for 25+ companies spread out over multiple locations and states\nDesigned and implemented backup and recovery options for clients according to uptime needs\nOversaw recovery operations during multiple server hardware or software failure incidents\nDocumented server configurations and standard procedures for in-house KnowledgeBase\nSoftware Development Team (November 2021 - May 2023)\nDesigned new SQL database for agricultural program focused on planting to harvesting process\nDeveloped UI/UX on new agricultural program using Blazer to display dynamic web pages\nIT Consultant (June 2020 - May 2023)\nPerformed standard helpdesk and on-call duties for all clients\nSuperior Ag Resources Co-op, Inc. #\rIT \u0026amp; Network Technician (May 2015 - February 2020)\nConfigured and deployed computers, printers, and cell phones\nInstalled and maintained virtual Microsoft Servers on physical VMware ESXi servers\nResolved Help Desk tickets for branches across Southern Indiana\nDesigned and implemented network infrastructure, including wiring Cat6 and Cat5 cabling on site\nConfigured and installed Allworx VOIP handsets and servers\nCreated standard operating procedures and documentation for software used by the company\nNoted Projects Spearheaded the research, configuration, and deployment of enterprise security software\nAided in mass domain migration and updating to Windows 10 for 16 branch locations\nCollaborated with other technicians to migrate from Netgear to Cisco devices at branch locations\nHR Solutions, Inc. #\rTemporary Assignment Worker (July 2014 - May 2015)\nRapidly adapted to operating and managing varied technologies in numerous environments\nInterfaced with employees at multiple assignments in companies of varied cultures\nEducation #\rBachelor of Science with Honors (May 2014)\nUniversity of Southern Indiana\nMajor: Computer Science\n","date":"23 May 2023","permalink":"/experience/","section":"Levi Odom","summary":"Skills #\rServer Administration \u0026ndash;","title":"Experience"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/history/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"history"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/resume/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"resume"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/plan/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"plan"},{"content":"Around 3 years ago, I was told by somewhat reputable sources on the Internet that having a website was a great way to impress prospective employers. This was with the idea that I’d be applying for software design positions, and a website is an excellent way to display a portfolio… that is, if I had one. So I purchased my name in website form - the commercial suffix, naturally - and a piece of a server somewhere I could put some files for other people to see.\nThe next question was what would I put on there? Well, until I actually started generating some projects, my website could be an extension of my resume - a way to display my skills in a creative form. The very fact that I had a website meant that I could make them. In this way, the site became a project itself; one I started to take seriously.\nSo how should it look? I knew I didn’t want it to be a single page, as I found them too odd - one of many eccentric opinions I still have. So, multi-page. How to design? Considering I had a limited amount of time to get it up, seeing as I needed a job ASAP, I opted to go with a template. This was a perfect approach for me - it was a perfect method to practice interpreting someone else’s code in order to make something new. In the process, I learned about the Bootstrap framework and deepened my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.\nThat was then. Now, I find myself older and cheaper (two more little mouths to feed means the 20 bucks spent on hosting is better used elsewhere). However, I also know just a bit more about programming, and I lack the desperation to cut corners in order to get something online to impress someone.\nIf there is one thing my current job has taught me it’s this: make a plan so everyone is on the same page. More exactly, make a plan so management’s happy. In this case, management is my hunt for my next opportunity; and it won’t be satisfied unless I deliver. Analogies aside, I figure going through some sort of process and documenting it in blog form is the best way to demonstrate to future employers (or anyone bored enough to read it) my work ethic, process, and, ideally, follow-through. It will also be a way for me to document the General Scope and Restrictions So I want to change my website, but what do I want to do with it? Well, I’d like to have a place to display at least one project. You might say my project count should be n + 1, with n being the number of projects I add after my first one. This first project is a ticketing program using .NET Core and Blazer, with C# as the background code. It’s a way to refresh myself and learn more about tools in which I have business-related experience: an agricultural data processing project I started at my current job.\nAnother thing I want to display, obviously, is a blog to document my progress. I can hard-code this, of course, but I think that would be inefficient when there are Content Management Systems (CMS’s) are a thing. So, I need to select a CMS, Static-Site Generator (SSG), or a combination of the two.\nFinally, I need to decide on an overall design that is visually appealing and easy to maintain. I’m not a UI/UX designer (but I play one on TV!), but learning more of those skills is something in which I’m interested. As before, for the sake of getting something pulled together as quickly as possible, I want to focus on the functionality. On the other hand, I don’t want to close off the opportunity to add in some flash. This, I believe, will be a factor in choosing what CMS/SSG I use to build the blog portion of the site - or it won’t and I’m worried about very little.\nSome restrictions to keep in mind: I do not have much web development experience. This is less of a restriction and more of a learning curve, as most of the reason I’m doing all of this in the first place is to expand my skills. That means learning web development. Whether I know it now or not is irrelevant. Another point: I cannot (yet) afford to host a site. The solution to this is using GitHub Pages for the time being. My www domain name is pointing to my current site hosted there also.\nTo hold myself a little more accountable (or to torture myself), I’m going to add some dates to when I expect to complete each general step. This will indubitably fluctuate as I gather more info and as the project progresses, but the initial steps should be attainable by their deadlines - unless I truly open a can of worms or life slams me against a wall. I’m only human after all, and I’m typing this in bed while my wife falls asleep; a situation I intend to emulate ASAP.\nBreaking down the big picture #\rSo the grand plan paints itself to be like this:\nResearch CMSs and SSGs compatible with GitHub pages (05/05/2023) Test initial blogging capability and, optionally, front-end flexibility (05/12/2023) Brainstorm and decide on a tentative theme or user experience (05/19/2023) Post the first blog (05/20/2023) Research/refresh myself in UI/UX design workflow; begin to generate design plans for site (05/26/2023) Define scope of ticket system project (05/19/2023) Research/refresh myself in software design process; specifically the deliverables expected (05/26/2023) Begin design on ticketing system workflow (06/02/2023) Generate database plan for ticketing system (06/09/2023) Generate low- to mid-level quality wireframes for ticketing system (06/16/2023) Re-evaluate the plan (06/23/2023) Begin coding ticketing system Test ticketing system Update website with more info and displays regarding the ticketing system project. Further define wireframes for website Create new landing page Get external input on website status Define further plans for hosting ticketing system, or leaving it local Put final touches on website Finalize ticketing system Begin project 2 for portfolio. My current plan leaves a lot to be desired. So, when do I get my site and my project?! Well, since I’m the customer on this one, I’m deciding that I’m okay with these steps so far. Data gained during the steps taken in the next few weeks will, without a doubt, change the plans for other steps. Defining them any more concretely is futile at this stage. Too much remains in the open. Since the process of breaking down problems into their smaller parts and formulating a plan is central to anything a software developer does (and pretty important to an IT worker as well), these further definition should come. However, without the ability to know for certain what design steps I’ll be taking before getting more research done, I can’t plan for something for whichI don’t have a frame of reference. Too much time has passed between now and the last time I dived into those processes.\nSo this is the start. This is where the plan begins. Hopefully, I can look back on this with a modicum of happiness.\nI can’t think of a catchy ending to wrap this up. It’s 11:40pm for me.
